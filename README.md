Node graph based GUI tool for building procedural noise. Uses libnoise under the hood for noise generation, so the resulting networks can easily be implemented in any app/game that uses libnoise.

The node graph itself is based on this github project (heavily modified for the particulars of this project): [react-node-graph](https://github.com/lightsinthesky/react-node-graph)

## Overview

React based node graph tool that allows the user to place libnoise modules on the canvas and link them up to generate complex coherent noise.
